## Pre-registration log

The current study was preregistered on ClnicalTrials.Gov ([NCT02331784](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02331784)):

There were few changes made after the pre-registration. The following is a list of changes and rationale for each. 

1. **Planned enrollment number changed from 40 to 68.**
We increased the number of participants from 40 to 68 to make up for a procedural error resulting in missing post-processing speed measures for the first 16 participants and therefore to have 40 participants with post-intervention processing speed measures. 

2. **Changes in the method of administering primary measures from NIH toolbox to locally stored tasks.**
Changes in the method of administering primary measures were based on discussion from the first DSMB meeting. DSMB members suggested to use locally stored task programs  instead of originally planned cognitive measures from NIH toolbox, based on their experience of using NIH toolbox (i.e., some outcome measures of NIH toolbox such as age-adjusted scores could be unreliable since the population used to calculate age-adjusted score was constantly changing with the collection of new data, and one DSMB member had experienced task condition changes outside of their control during a trial). All changes to cognitive measures were approved by the DSMB before trial initiation. 

3. **The change of inclusion criteria from MMSE to MoCA.**
The change of inclusion criteria was made before initiation of the trial based on the suggestion of DSMB members during our first meeting. The primary reason for change was evidence suggesting the MoCA may detect MCI with 90% and 87% sensitivity and specificity, compared with MMSE with 18% and 100% respectively (Nasreddine et al., 2005). 

4. **Minimization as our randomization method.**
The use of the minimization method for randomization was based on recommendation from the first DSMB meeting. Minimization is a method of adaptive randomization. The aim of minimization is to minimize the imbalance between treatment groups over a number of prognostic factors. Minimization first calculates imbalance within each factor and then determines overall imbalance between groups by summing individual imbalances. When a new participant is enrolled, the participant is assigned to the group which yields the lowest imbalance score. While this process is somewhat logistically cumbersome, it was a pragmatic approach for maintaining balance on important baseline variables in relatively small sample size trial.
