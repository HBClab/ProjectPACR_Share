Tasks:
  - Visual Short Term Memory:
    - description: >
        An array of four objects briefly appeared on the screen. After a delay,
        an object appeared and participants had to decide whether this stimulus was
        in the original array. The experiment consisted of three blocks with
        targets varying in color, shape, (practice blocks) and conjunctions of
        color and shape (task block), respectively. Visual short term memory was
        measured by the composite of RT and accuracy (i.e., average of normalized
        scores of RT and accuracy) on the conjunction condition. Practice trials-
        (color: 4, shape: 4, both: 4)

  - N-back:
    - description: >
        Participants viewed a sequence of centrally presented letters. For each
        letter, participants were instructed to determine if the letter was the
        same as the previous letter (practice block), or the same as the letter
        two back (task block). N-back memory was measured by the composite of RT
        and accuracy on the two-back condition.
    - notes: >
        The number of stimuli was constant (100), but for the 1-back, the
        participant does not respond to the first stimulus, and for the 2-back,
        the participant does not respond to the first two stimuli, resulting in
        99 and 98 responses, respectively.

        On each trial, a configuration of four black dots was presented on the
        screen. After a brief delay, one dot appeared and participants were
        instructed to determine if the dot was in the same position as one of the
        black dots presented earlier in that trial. Spatial working memory was
        measured by the composite of RT and accuracy.

  - Color Stroop:
    - description: >
        Participants viewed a sequence of words and were asked to determine the
        color of the word. Three trial types were randomly presented: congruent
        (e.g., word “red” in red ink), neutral (e.g., word “dog” in red ink), or
        incongruent (e.g., word “red” in blue ink). The Stroop cost was calculated
        by contrasting the composite scores of congruent and incongruent
        conditions.

  - Attentional Blink:
    - description: >
        Participants viewed sequences of rapidly presented (17 ms) black letters.
        The time between presented letters is 75 ms.
        In each sequence, a white letter appeared (location in sequence varied
        between the 7th, 10th, and 13th letter) and a probe followed the white
        letter at varying lags (2, 4, 6, or 8 letters after). During the
        critical condition, participants were asked to identify the white letter
        and the following probe. The Attentional Blink was calculated by
        contrasting the composite scores of the probe appeared on lag 2 (probe
        appeared 2 items after the white letter) and lag 8 (probe appeared 8 items
        after the white letter).
    - notes: >
        After each trial the participant was asked about the white letter and
        if a probe appeared.

  - Flanker:
    - description: >
        Participants responded to the direction of a central arrow that pointed
        in the same (congruent) or opposite direction (incongruent) as four other
        adjacent arrows (two on each side). The Flanker cost was calculated by
        contrasting the composite scores of congruent and incongruent conditions
    - notes: >
        The iti is distributed between 2000-10000 ms, with an average of 2500 ms

  - Digit Symbol Substitution
    - description: >
        A dictionary connecting the symbols and numeric digits is at the top of a
        printed sheet, and below were rows of numbers with an open box below each
        number for the participant to write the corresponding symbol. After eight
        practice trials, participants were given two minutes to fill out as many
        of the boxes as they could.

  - Pattern Comparison
    - description: >
        Two patterns are presented side by side with a line between them for the
        participant to place the letter 'S'(same) or 'D'(different) between the
        patterns. After three practice trials, participants are given 30 seconds
        to compare as many patterns as they can. After 30 seconds, the participants
        are given another sheet and another 30 seconds to fill out as many patterns
        as they can again.
    - notes: >
        The outcome measure is the average number of patterns correctly compared
        between the two 30 second periods.

  - Trails A & B:
    - description: >
        Both parts of the Trail Making Test consist of 25 circles distributed over a sheet of paper.
        In Part A, the circles are numbered 1 – 25, and the participant drew
        lines to connect the numbers in ascending order. In Part B, the circles
        include both numbers (1 – 13) and letters (A – L); as in Part A, the participant
        drew lines to connect the circles in an ascending pattern, but with the added
        task of alternating between the numbers and letters (i.e., 1-A-2-B-3-C, etc.).
        The participant was instructed to connect the circles as quickly as possible,
        without lifting the pen or pencil from the paper. If the participant made an error,
        we pointed it out immediately and allowed the participant to correct it.
        Errors affect the participant's score only in that the correction of errors
        was included in the completion time for the task.
